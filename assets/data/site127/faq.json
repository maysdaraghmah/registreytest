    "question": "I’m having trouble understanding all the numbers. What does it mean “Gifts bought online”? What does it mean “Vouchers issued”? What does it mean “Remaining list balance”?",
    "answer": "Gifts bought online: Many of your guests will purchase or chip-in for your gift through the online Gift Registry. The total value of gifts purchased or chipped in for through the online Gift Registry is provided here. You can create voucher(s) from this total and use them to redeem your gifts at your local Borsheims store. Vouchers issued: If you have requested and received one or more Vouchers, their total will be shown under this heading. This is the total of the original issuance value of the Vouchers and does not account for any spent through those Vouchers. Remaining list balance: This is the difference between ‘Gifts bought online’ and ‘Vouchers Issued’ and with its value you can create a Voucher (i.e. some gifts have not yet been converted to Vouchers). Once you choose to create a Voucher and it is issued, the “remaining list balance” should change to zero (unless more gifts have been bought for you in the meantime!)",

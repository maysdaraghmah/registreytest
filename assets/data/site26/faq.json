    "question": "How does the gift registry work?",
    "answer": "We’ve built the registry to be as simple and straightforward as possible. With the Nebraska Furniture Mart gift registry, you’ll be able to register for any item we sell. Given NFM’s incredible product selection, we wanted to make sure our gift registry and app supported it all. You can download the Nebraska Furniture Mart Gift Registry app on the App Store or Google Play. Simply browse through our store and scan (or input) the items that you’d like to add to your registry.<br><br> Your guests can browse your registry and purchase or chip in towards any item on your gift registry. This offers you the freedom to make adjustments to your list if you change your mind about a product once your event has arrived.<br><br> You can also register for bigger items that may require several “chip ins” from friends and family. How is this possible? When you register with NFM, anyone you share your list with will have the ability to chip in or fully fund any item on your list! Chipping in allows friends and family to fund your gift registry as generously as they like. Once you’re ready to bring home items on your registry, you will be issued a voucher with the available funds. You can choose to use your funds on any of the items on your list, or if they’re not in stock or are no longer available, you’ll be able to use the funds on any item that we sell. Feel free to use your voucher just as you would a credit card and go on a spending spree with Nebraska Furniture Mart! The prices on NFM Gift Registry are to be used as a guide and are not representative of any current promotions in store or online. This price level helps ensure that when your items are funded by your friends and family you will be ensured to have enough money to cover the item regardless of the sale price at the time."

    "question": "I’m having trouble understanding all the numbers. What does it mean “Gifts bought online”? What does it mean “Vouchers issued”? What does it mean “Remaining list balance”?",
    "answer": "Gifts bought online: Many of your guests will purchase or chip-in for your gift through the online Gift Registry. The total value of gifts purchased or chipped in for through the online Gift Registry is provided here. You can create voucher(s) from this total and use them to redeem your gifts at your local NFM store.<br><br> Vouchers issued: If you have requested and received one or more Vouchers, their total will be shown under this heading. This is the total of the original issuance value of the Vouchers and does not account for any spend through those Vouchers.<br><br> Remaining list balance: This is the difference between ‘Gifts bought online’ and ‘Vouchers Issued’ and with its value you can create a Voucher (i.e. some gifts have not yet been converted to Vouchers). Once you choose to create a Voucher and it is issued, the “remaining list balance” should change to zero (unless more gifts have been bought for you in the meantime!)",

A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile may be used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.

Communications from the Site We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes. Sharing Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers for the purpose of improving services and products. We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services.

Contact information may be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information may be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. Security JIFITI PRODUCTS take every precaution to protect user information. When users submit sensitive information via JIFITI PROCUTS, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected. Supplementation of Information In order for JIFITI PRODUCTS to properly fulfill its obligation to users it may be necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we may provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information.

Find items that capture your personality and align with your hobbies, interests, and style. If you love to travel, find luggage you love. If you’re a music lover, register for a home stereo system. Look for ways to make your registry uniquely your own."
				},
				{
					"header": "2. Consider Price",
					"text": "It’s a great idea to include a variety of price points on your registry so that all your guests can find a gift they’re happy to give. It’s good to provide options ranging from about $25 to $500. With our Group Gifting option, multiple guests can pitch in toward higher priced items, so it is OK to register for some larger gifts."
				},
				{
					"header": "3. Upgrade Existing Items",
					"text": "Your wedding registry is the perfect opportunity to replace worn-out or low-quality products that you already have in your life. From quality sheets and bedding to that professional-grade cookware you’ve had your eye on, your wedding registry is a great place to upgrade to more luxury-minded household items."
